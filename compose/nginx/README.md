Docker container for a reverse proxy (with self-signed SSL) to
localhost. Serves content on ports 80 and 443 from a backend on the
host running on port 8080.

The docker host is usually `172.*` and this needs to be hard-coded in
the server configuration. Edit `conf/conf.d/server.conf` and change
the address to make it work if it isn't sending traffic your way. You
can use this command to check

```
$ docker run -i ubuntu /sbin/ip route|awk '/default/ { print $3 }'
```

or you can just start the proxy and hit it from curl or a browser on
the host and look at the access logs on the console of docker-compose:

```
$ docker-compose up
Creating nginx_nginx_1...
Attaching to nginx_nginx_1
nginx_1 | 172.17.42.1 - - [14/May/2015:09:35:26 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 502 537 "-" "curl/7.35.0" "-"
...
```

The port of the backend server is also hard coded (to 8080) in the
same place.

> TIP: you can edit the nginx configuration and restart the server without killing the docker container. Just `docker kill -s HUP <container name>` where `<container name>` is something like `nginx_nginx_1` (generated by docker-compose).
